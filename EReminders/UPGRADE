UPGRADE INFORMATION for 0.9:

If upgrading from .85 or higher, there's nothing to be done!


UPGRADE INFORMATION for 0.85-0.86:

There was a serious security issue with all previous versions.  Anyone
could load your config.in file (with database passwords and login) from
the Internet.

There are no changes in this release, except a security fix.

To implement the fix yourself without replacing everything,
follow this procedure:

	1.  Rename config.in to config.php
	2.  Change the line require("config.in"); to
	    require("config.php"); at the beginning of the database.php
 	    file.
	3.  You're done!

This makes it impossible to load your config.in file from the internet
since the server attempts to parse it if it is named config.php, and
nothing is displayed to the calling browser.

UPGRADE INFORMATION for 0.2-0.85:

In order to upgrade to this version from previous versions, you need to
drop the old database, and create a new one because we've added a few
fields to the database.

Unfortunately, there are no scripts available to upgrade your data,
however, if you take a look at the new database format, and modify your
current tables and add the data for the current entries, you should be
able to get it working.

The mail.php script should no longer be set to be run from the crontab as
before.  It is no longer required that you install the php cgi module.
You only need to have php installed as a module in apache.  Follow the
instructions in the INSTALL documentation for the recommended entries in
your crontab.

UPGRADE INFORMATION for 0.1-0.2:

Nothing.  Just replace the files with this version.  The database format
didn't change, so you don't need to recreate any databases.

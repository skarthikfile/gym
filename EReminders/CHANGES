History of E*Reminders
----------------------
Late one night Jim Suto (jim@amazinglinux.com) was awake and started
thinking that since e-mail is becoming so widely used these days, it would be
nice to have a way that a system can provide notifications and reminders via
this medium. Especially if you have a cellphone equipped with email capability
this could be very handy.

He told Ben Suto of the idea and Ben thought it would make sense to code the
interface in PHP. Ben put together the script a couple of days later and Ben and
Jim tested it and were really happy with the result. Jim later also refined the
code himself somewhat and gave Ben the ok to make it GPL and release it.

E*Reminders was reviewed once in the Linux Journal magazine.

Ben passed away unfortunately and suddenly late in 2000, and will be missed
from the project. He provided a terrific code foundation which runs
E*Reminders today.

-Full, working merge of David Rose's patch.
- Ereminders now supports htaccess user authentication. Wahoo!

June 13, 2005: Roland Krystian Alberciak <krystian@mindspring.com>

-Part 1 of 2 of merging David Rose's patches. 
-Few minor usability adjustments in this release, namely the ability
 to easily permit the E*Reminders to run in a timezone different than user
 and have user experiance no problems (you may set a default timezone to be 
 presented to you that differs from the timezone E*Reminders is installed in)
-- Variable $dbtzcorrect is removed and replaced by two variables:
   $dbtzoffset, server timezone
   $defaulttz, timezone presented to users (the idea is this may be different than $dbtzoffset)
-Removed the .htaccess file from the directory in this installation.
-- Don't want to override the behaviour of a parent directory htaccess file.
-Fixed problem with scheduling reminders at 12:00 AM/PM
--Warning message issued to user about scheduling reminders at noon or midnight. 
   This is intended to inform users about possible dangers when scheduling
   reminders at these times. This is particularly because the interface does not
   permit scheduling a reminder at noon or midnight (instead, it permits 12:00 PM/AM)

June 03, 2005: Roland Krystian Alberciak <krystian@mindspring.com>

-Corrected errors which remained after internationalization.
-- Users may now switch between languages freely without source modifications.
-- Previously, italian language parameters were hard coded into the source code.

-Compacted help_en, help_it > help.php. Similarly, EReminder_en, EReminder_it > EReminder.php
-- Hence: Future translators can just worry about translating the text and not fitting it to the code.

-Corrected file extensions for language files so that: en.inc > en.php for security reasons
-- view UPGRADE file under heading "UPGRADE INFORMATION for 0.85-0.86"
-- Also, english was a non functional file since it lacked <? ?> wrappers.

- Additionally, there were some timezone problems
-- Apparently, everytime I sent an email to send on the same day, the program shows it as being scheduled to send the day ahead of the current day. Same goes with a day far into the future, the program adds 1 day.

- The Advance email feature didn't work
-- There was a mixup in what was posted by a form submission.

- The current month didn't appear as an option in a drop down menu.
-- Some basic code took care of this.


Finally, a log of select changes:


Oct 04, 2003: Nino Vessella (nino@vessella.it)

- Tutto il codice è stato modificato in modo da poter localizzare i messaggi:
	a) tutti gli html sono diventati php
	b) tutti i file richiedono un file con i testi dei messaggi: en.inc, it.inc, ecc.
	c) i file help.php e EReminder.php devono essere tradotti nella lingua locale
		aggiungendovi il codice della lingua, es.: help_en.php/EReminder_en.php per l'inglese e
		help_it.php/EReminder_it.php per l'italiano

- Il codice di index.php è stato leggermente modificato

Oct 31, 2002: E*Reminders-0.91 Released to Original Authors

- Fixed date display error in delete results window, thanks to Daniel Drucker
  for the report.  Improved uses text in help and config windows.

Dec 14, 2000: E*Reminders-0.9 Released to Original Authors
		(courtesy, Glen Stewart)

- Accounts older than 90 days with no pending reminders are purged
  automatically as part of mail.php functions.  This took care of
  the one thing left in the old TODO list.
- More help and descriptions on the main E*Reminder page.
- Date and time default to server time when first page is brought up.
  This means the old index.html has become index.php
- New accounts are told to get their password from email and use their
  BACK button to set their first reminder.
- References to config.in have been changed to config.php in INSTALL,
  which was also slightly simplified.

April 24, 1999: E*Reminders-0.86 Release

- Fixed security hole where database password is readable from the
  Internet.  For instructions on how to implement this fix without
  replacing 0.85 entirely, read the file UPGRADE that should have
  come with your distribution of this software.

April 23, 1999: E*Reminders-0.85 Released

- Small modifications of GUI, increased level of consistency.
- New mechanism for creating accounts to keep system from being misused.
- Users can now block any E-mail from going to their accounts.
- Cleaned up some of the messages, and made the software more modular.
- Small modifications of INSTALL documentation.


April 17, 1999: E*Reminders-0.8 Released to Original Authors
		(courtesy, Glen Stewart)

- HTML GUI given a consistent, polished look
- Timezone support added to event entry page & subsequent output
- Extensive info supplied to event recipient to identify possible abusers
  and to stop recurring events.  IP #'s and dates are tracked.
- Recurring & notify value bugs fixed from previous release
- Added "Event" name (Subject, actually) instead of truncating the message
  body for a partial subject.
- Added mouse-tip help "?" icons to the entry page to get users rolling.
- Switched system to .php files - mail.php now executed via wget or lynx cron
- Shipping releases will not allow recurring events of minute and hour duration
  due to possible abuses and server loading.  If you need this, find the
  commented-out section of index.html
- Revised date displays throughout for consistency.
- Added support for monthly and yearly recurring events.
- Added options in config.in for dbtimezone and dbtzcorrect.
  Read about these in the README file (which is also much improved).
- Enjoy!


February 5, 1999: EReminders-0.02 Released

- The database name has been changed from calendar to reminders
- Some general tweaks
- Some of the prompts have been made a little friendlier.
- Updates to install documentation.
- Fixed a bug where if a user created a reminder that was set in the past,
  and he sets it recurring, it would send them a message every time
  mail.php is run.  Now, it will automatically make it recur at the next
  time in the future, and will honor the recurrence settings.

November 30, 1998: Initial Release
